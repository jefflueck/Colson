            Most of our Bible study throughout our Christian lives focuses on
            understanding God and learning how to live in right relationship to
            Him, ourselves and each other&hyphen;and this is certainly vital to
            our spiritual growth. However, the Bible also teaches us how to live
            in right relationship to every aspect of God's creation, which
            includes society, culture, art, economics, education and politics
            just to name a few. Furthurmore, the Bible helps us understand how
            to properly order &lpar;or re&hyphen;order&rpar; the fallen world as
            we join Christ in his work of restoring all things&period; This is
